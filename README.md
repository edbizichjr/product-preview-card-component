## Overview

Build a product card off of reference images for desktop and mobile.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

I started with looking at the design images and thinking about the structure in html. After laying down the basic structure I started to import the fonts needed and styled the page. I constantly refreshed as I made changes to ensure the card was turning out. When I hit a small snag I referenced W3 schools or youtube to help with some css.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Learning how to make a simple card component and the importance of blocking things out in divs.

### Continued development

I want to continue to practice flexbox and grid to properly align items.
